## Acknowledgements

We would like to thank the MYOSA platform for providing the hardware ecosystem and development support. This project is inspired by the need for non-invasive, privacy-safe learning support systems for neurodivergent individuals, especially children with autism and ADHD.

## Overview

This project is a **neuroadaptive learning companion system** that helps users stay focused, regulate behavior, and improve engagement during learning sessions.

Instead of using cameras or microphones, the system relies on:
- motion sensing,
- interaction detection,
- environmental awareness,

to understand behavioral patterns and provide adaptive feedback.

**Problem Statement:**
Many existing learning systems rely on intrusive monitoring (cameras, microphones), do not adapt to individual behavior, fail to support sensory-sensitive users, and lack real-time feedback. This project solves that by creating a **privacy-safe, adaptive, real-time behavioral support system.**

**Key features:**
* real-time behavioral analysis  
* adaptive feedback system  
* sensory-aware interaction  
* engagement and focus tracking  
* non-invasive design (no camera, no mic)  
* personalized learning support

## Features

The system is designed with multiple hardware and software features that work together to create an interactive and engaging learning experience. Each feature is described in detail below.

---

### **1. Real-time behavioral analysis**

The system continuously analyzes:
- motion patterns (mpu6050),
- interaction frequency (apds9960),
- environmental conditions (bmp180).

It detects focus, restlessness, disengagement, overload indicators, and recovery patterns.

---

### **2. Adaptive feedback system**

Based on detected states, the system responds with oled messages, rgb led signals, and gentle buzzer tones.

Example:
- **focused** → encouragement  
- **restless** → calming suggestion  
- **overload** → recovery guidance  

---

### **3. Sensory-aware interaction**

Designed for neurodivergent users:
- no flashing lights,
- no loud alarms,
- smooth transitions,
- calming visuals.

---

### **4. Engagement tracking**

Tracks focus duration, interaction gaps, behavioral transitions, and session performance.

---

### **5. Companion-like interaction**

The device behaves like a supportive companion:
- gives encouragement,
- suggests breaks,
- rewards progress,
- builds routines.

---

### **6. Backend intelligence engine**

All processing happens on a system backend:
- sensor fusion,
- behavioral state detection,
- engagement scoring,
- adaptive decision-making.
